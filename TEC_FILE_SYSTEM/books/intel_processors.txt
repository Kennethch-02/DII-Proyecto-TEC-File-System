1.) Compatibility. Being one of the most important processor brand names on the market, the Intel CPUs are available widely. This provides consumers with a more flexible ability of PC choices, a greater variety of features, and can be found in devices going for a lower price.  
2.) Power Consumption. Intel processors in notebook computers are not electricity-intensive, using less power than other CPUs on the market. For instance, the AMD CPU uses up to double or even triple the wattage as Intel’s Atom CPU, which powers the Netbook. The difference is readily noticeable in the battery by comparison.
3.) Heat Generation. Due to is lower wattage consumption, the Intel processing chips generate less heat. In a mini-computer, builders pack parts more tightly together, so less heat generated by the processor causes everything else to stay cooler.
4.) Production Capacity. With 15 CPU development plants globally, Intel can generate a higher fabrication volume, meaning that their CPUs are going to be available more widely and used in a significant number of machines.
5.) Integrated Graphics: Generally, when you’re looking at a CPU, it comes down to either AMD or Intel. One thing that gives Intel an upper hand is that it comes with integrated Iris or HD graphics out of the box. That means you can go straight to gaming or streaming high-quality video without a GPU.
